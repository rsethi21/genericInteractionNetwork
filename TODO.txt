TODOs
# Primary
- add types enzyme, protein, ligand, other; within enzyme add active/inactive fields if necessary
- stimulus should only have max-value and timing change
- make it so that the stimulus and substrate have a separately defined interaction
- add to modifyIt and use it in the other algorithms
	- change the hardcoded splicing to fluid ones that use the special characters as guides
- migrate graphing code to graphIt module; ensure ability to graph experimental data
- incopororate cooperativity and MM kinetics expressions for more robust modelling (expanding from the ODEs that this one creates)
- explore fitter function (explore algorithms to allow for better fit)
  - genetic algorithm --> complete implementation
- populate statistics module with simple statistical analyses
- test machine and deep learning models that can use the labels generated by the model and train on some data to create a predictive algorithm of states
# Secondary
- incorporate logging functionality
- develop readme and add comments to code for readability
- error handling (try/except)
- revamp project structuring once i get a grasp on importing within projects
