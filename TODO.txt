TODOs
# Primary
- Could create a run_interaction function that would allow the user to open up an interact session if accessing object from a juypter notebook (tested it out, could return an interaction object that can be called from the juypter notebook; down the road see if possible to create ad hoc html page to do this).
  - stimulus should only have max-value and timing change
- add to modifyIt
- migrate graphing code to graphIt module; ensure ability to graph experimental data
- incopororate cooperativity and MM kinetics expressions for more robust modelling (expanding from the ODEs that this one creates)
- explore fitter function (explore algorithms to allow for better fit)
  - genetic algorithm
- populate statistics module with simple statistical analyses
# Secondary
- incorporate logging functionality
- develop readme and add comments to code for readability
- error handling (try/except)
